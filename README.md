# Penis Shape Recognition AI and training data generation

This code was used to generate artificial penis shapes on satellite images with the purpose of classifying genuine penis shapes in the world. This repository also contains the code (as jupyter notebook) that was used to train the actual Convolutional Neural Network that was used to detect these shapes.

## How to use

Source files of the penis shapes have been converted to PNG files and classified. These are included in the repository. The CreateModifiedTiles.py file will add these shapes randomly to the tiles present in the tiles folder. Some tiles are included to get you started but it is advised that you download more for better results. The next step is to use the jupyter notebook file to train the AI. The resulting model and interface to use it can be found in another repository: [AI Satellite Tile Classifier Interface](https://github.com/program-sam/AI-satellite-tile-classifier-interface)
